# Victor Balaniouk website for $6.99

The main purpose of this project is to learn the basics of Django and build my own personal website. Since the code isn't rocket science, it doesn't have many comments. But I  think it could be helpful for someone :)

## 💰 The "Low-Cost" Goal
One of my main goals was to keep development as cheap as possible. Thanks to free hosting options, I managed to reach this goal by **paying only $6.99 for the domain.**

## 🛠 Tools & Tech Stack
Aside from **Python** and **Django**, these are the tools that made this project possible:

* **[Figma](https://figma.com):** Used for the visual design and the initial UI sketches.
* **[Cursor](https://cursor.com):** I used the free version, and it was a game-changer—about 80% of the code was written with Cursor's help.
* **[Telegram Bot](https://telegram.org/blog/bot-revolution):** I use this as a messenger service to send me notifications whenever someone fills out the contact form.
* **[Render](https://render.com):** The hosting service where the site is currently published. It's running on the **Free Tier** for now, though I might upgrade in the future.
